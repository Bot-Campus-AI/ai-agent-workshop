This workflow processes resumes and determines a candidateâ€™s suitability for an **AI Trainer** role by:

* Extracting text from uploaded PDF resumes
* Sending the content to OpenAI for analysis
* Parsing and structuring the results
* Appending the evaluated data into a connected **Google Sheet**

---

## ðŸš€ Workflow Steps

1. **Webhook**

   * Endpoint: `POST /webhook-test/resume-screener`
   * Accepts: `multipart/form-data` with `data` as the file key
   * Supports: Multiple file uploads (ensure Postman/Webhook settings support multiple binaries)

2. **Extract from File**

   * Reads and extracts text from each uploaded resume PDF.

3. **OpenAI (GPT-3.5-Turbo)**

     * Candidate Name
     * Total Years of Experience
     * Skills
     * Suitability for AI Trainer role (`Yes/No + Reason`)
     * Tags (e.g., `"Python"`, `"Cloud"`, `"Trainer"`)

4. **Edit Fields**

   * Transforms OpenAI response into structured fields:

     * `name`
     * `is_fit_for_ai_trainer`
     * `reason`
     * `skills`
     * `tags`
     * `timestamp` (formatted as `Wed, 23 Jul 2025`)

5. **Google Sheets**

     * ðŸ”— [Google Sheet]
     * Sheet Name: `Sheet1`
